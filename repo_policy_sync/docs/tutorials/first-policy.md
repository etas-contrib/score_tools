# Tutorial: create your first policy

This tutorial creates, tests, and plans a small policy that ensures generated
build output is ignored. It assumes you have completed the installation steps
in the [project README](../../README.md).

Bundled policies are small, versioned specifications with executable examples.
Create a directory under `repo_policy_sync/policies/` and give it a stable,
lowercase directory name:

```text
policies/
  ensure-build-directory-ignored/
    policy.yml
    missing-ignore-rule/
      before/
      after/
```

Start with a minimal definition:

```yaml
title: "chore: ignore generated build directory"
description: Keep generated build output out of version control.

ensure:
  - type: ensure_line
    path: .gitignore
    line: _build
    rationale: Build output is generated locally.
```

> [!WARNING]
> Only automate requirements that have one unambiguous valid solution. If a
> repository can satisfy the requirement in several equally valid ways, a
> policy that enforces one representation will create unnecessary pull
> requests or overwrite an intentional choice. Narrow the requirement first,
> or write a check that accepts all valid forms.

The policy directory name (`ensure-build-directory-ignored`) is its permanent
ID and determines the policy-owned branch and pull-request marker. Keep it
stable after rollout; renaming a policy is a first-version breaking change.

Add the smallest representative input tree under `before/`, then the exact
expected tree under `after/`. The fixture test applies every bundled policy,
compares its output with `after/`, and confirms a second application makes no
changes:

```bash
uv run pytest -q repo_policy_sync/tests/test_policy_fixtures.py
```

Run the complete policy-sync suite before rolling out a policy:

```bash
uv run pytest -q repo_policy_sync/tests
```

Use plan mode against one known repository before enabling apply mode for an
organization:

```bash
uv run score-repo-policy-sync plan \
  --org eclipse-score \
  --repo example-repository \
  --policy ensure-build-directory-ignored
```
