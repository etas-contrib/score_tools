# CLI reference

```text
score-repo-policy-sync COMMAND [OPTIONS]
```

`COMMAND` is one of `plan` or `apply`. Policy options may also be set in the
TOML configuration. Explicit
command-line values override values from the configuration. The organization
may therefore be supplied either with `--org` or in TOML. Report output paths
are CLI-only.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `plan` | Evaluate policies without changing repositories. Exit status `1` indicates drift. |
| `apply` | Apply policies and create or update policy-owned pull requests. |

## Typical

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--org NAME` | GitHub organization to scan. May be set in TOML. |
| `--policy NAME` | Select a policy by directory name from local or bundled policies. Repeat to select more than one; when present, only the selected policies run. Defaults to all local and bundled policies. |
| `--repo NAME` | Restrict the run to an exact repository name. Repeat to select more than one. |
| *(stdout)* | Always prints the terminal policy-evaluation table. |

## Rare

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--config PATH` | TOML configuration file. Defaults to `score-repo-policy-sync.toml` in the current working directory when present. This and the report output path options are CLI-only. |
| `--json-output PATH` | Also write the versioned JSON report to `PATH`. |
| `--markdown-output PATH` | Also write the Markdown report to `PATH`. |
| `--policy-dir PATH` | Local policy directory. Repeat to combine directories. Defaults to `./policies` in the current working directory when present. |
| `--exclude-policy NAME` | Exclude one local or bundled policy. Applied after any explicit `--policy` selection; repeat to exclude more than one. |
| `--recreate` | On `apply`, rebuild one existing policy-owned pull request from its repository's current default branch. Requires exactly one `--repo` and exactly one `--policy`. |
| `--allow-dirty-pr`, `--no-allow-dirty-pr` | After the automatic formatting-fix retry, commit and push changes even if pre-commit still fails; create or keep the pull request as a draft and add a comment with the failure. |
| `--quiet`, `--no-quiet` | Suppress progress messages on standard error. The report remains on standard output. |

## Debugging only

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--cache-dir PATH` | Directory for disposable checkouts. Defaults to the XDG cache directory. |
| `--sync-workers N` | Number of concurrent checkout refreshes. Defaults to the available CPU count, with a minimum of `1`. |
| `--policy-workers N` | Number of repositories evaluated or applied concurrently for each policy. Defaults to the available CPU count, with a minimum of `1`. Set to `1` to process policies serially. |

Archived repositories are excluded from every run. Selecting an archived
repository with `--repo` fails validation instead of silently ignoring it.

## Exit status

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | The plan found no required changes, or apply mode completed without errors. |
| `1` | Plan mode found one or more required changes. |
| `2` | Invalid input or an authentication, GitHub, Git, or policy execution error occurred. |

## JSON report

`--json-output PATH` writes one JSON document to `PATH`. The top-level
`schema_version` currently has value `2`. The `summary` object separately
reports repository synchronization, policy evaluation, pull-request activity
(including automatic closures), and elapsed duration; each `outcomes` element
includes the policy, repository, applicability result, status, planned or
applied changes, pull request URL, policy pull-request status, warnings, and
error. `--markdown-output PATH`
writes the compact Markdown matrix to `PATH`. JSON and Markdown output paths
can be supplied together so all reports are generated from one run.

See the [configuration reference](configuration.md) for the TOML format.
