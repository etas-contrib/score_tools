# Configuration reference

The optional `score-repo-policy-sync.toml` file in the current working
directory configures the policy command. Use `--config PATH` to select another
file. If `--config` is not supplied and the default file is absent, the command
continues with its defaults. `--config`, `--json-output`, and
`--markdown-output` are CLI-only.

```toml
[score-repo-policy-sync]

org = "eclipse-score"
policies = ["my-local-policy"]
repos = ["reference_integration"]

# Relative paths are resolved relative to this TOML file.
policy_dirs = ["policies", "shared-policies"]

# Local and bundled policies are enabled by default; list only intentional exclusions.
exclude_policies = [
  "minimum-bazel-version",
]

recreate = false
allow_dirty_pr = false
quiet = false
cache_dir = ".cache/repo-policy-sync"
pull_request_template = "templates/repo-policy-sync-pull-request.md"
sync_workers = 4
policy_workers = 4
```

The TOML keys map to the corresponding CLI options as follows:

| TOML key | CLI option |
| --- | --- |
| `org` | `--org` |
| `policies` | repeated `--policy` |
| `repos` | repeated `--repo` |
| `policy_dirs` | repeated `--policy-dir` |
| `exclude_policies` | repeated `--exclude-policy` |
| `recreate` | `--recreate` / `--no-recreate` |
| `allow_dirty_pr` | `--allow-dirty-pr` / `--no-allow-dirty-pr` |
| `quiet` | `--quiet` / `--no-quiet` |
| `cache_dir` | `--cache-dir` |
| `pull_request_template` | `--pull-request-template` |
| `sync_workers` | `--sync-workers` |
| `policy_workers` | `--policy-workers` |

`policy_dirs` is optional. If it is omitted, `./policies` is used when that
directory exists. Setting it to `[]` disables local policy directories.

`exclude_policies` accepts local or bundled policy directory names. When an option is present on the command line, its value replaces the
corresponding TOML value, including list-valued options. Unknown policy names
and unknown TOML fields are errors.

`pull_request_template` selects the body template for newly created and
updated policy pull requests. Relative TOML paths are resolved relative to the
configuration file. The command-line override resolves relative paths from the
current working directory. If omitted, the packaged
`repo_policy_sync/templates/pull_request.md` template is used.

Templates must contain each supported placeholder exactly by name; whitespace
inside the braces is allowed:

| Placeholder | Rendered value |
| --- | --- |
| `{{ policy_id }}` | Policy identifier. |
| `{{ policy_description }}` | Policy description, or the default description. |
| `{{ policy_trigger }}` | Why the repository matches the policy. |
| `{{ changes }}` | Markdown list of changed files and rationales. |
| `{{ failure_section }}` | Automation failure details, or empty text. |

Missing or unknown placeholders are configuration errors. The ownership,
branch-head, and generation markers are hidden internal metadata and are
appended automatically to every generated policy pull request; custom
templates do not need to know about them.

Values in `repos` use the same repository selection rules as `--repo`: values
without `*`, `?`, or `[` are exact names, while values containing those
characters use case-sensitive Python `fnmatch` semantics. For example,
`repos = ["score*"]` selects every active repository whose name starts with
`score`. A pattern that matches no repository eligible for synchronization is
diagnosed separately from an exact repository name that is not present. When
`--recreate` is used, the expanded selection must contain exactly one
repository before checkout.
