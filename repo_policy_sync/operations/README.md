# Built-in policy operations

Policy `ensure` entries use the operation types registered in
[`__init__.py`](__init__.py). This directory contains every operation
available to a policy; operation IDs are part of the policy file format and
must be registered before they can be used.

Use the catalogue below to choose an operation. The
[policy format reference](../docs/reference/policy-format.md) is the
authoritative source for the complete schema, validation rules, and examples.

## Operations

| Operation | Use it for | Main behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ensure_line` | Keeping one exact line in a text file | Inserts the desired line, removes configured replacements and duplicates, and creates a missing file. |
| `ensure_minimum_version` | Maintaining a simple version file such as `.bazelversion` | Replaces a lower `major.minor.patch` value; equal or higher versions and missing files are compliant. |
| `ensure_no_such_file` | Removing an obsolete file | Deletes an existing file; a missing file is compliant and directories are rejected. |
| `ensure_bazel_dependency` | Adding a direct devcontainer dependency to `MODULE.bazel` | Reads the version from one Dockerfile image tag and adds the dependency when it is missing. |
| `migrate_devcontainer_json` | Converting an image-based devcontainer to a Dockerfile-based one | Migrates supported JSONC configuration, writes the destination, and removes the source while rejecting ambiguous or conflicting files. |
| `replace_regex` | Applying a narrow text substitution | Applies Python `re.sub` to a complete UTF-8 file; missing files and non-matching patterns are compliant. |
| `synchronize_devcontainer_version` | Keeping a devcontainer image and Bazel dependency aligned | Finds one Dockerfile image tag and one direct `bazel_dep`, then upgrades the lower numeric version. |
| `synchronize_bazel_dependencies` | Aligning a set of bzlmod dependencies and BUILD references | Updates configured direct dependencies, renames legacy modules, and manages configured git overrides. |
| `synchronize_file` | Distributing a checked-in policy asset | Copies a policy-local UTF-8 asset to a repository-relative target and can set its executable bit. |

All operations accept an optional `rationale`. When a change is needed, the
rationale is included with the generated change description.

## Common rules

- Operation paths are relative to the repository root unless the policy
  format explicitly describes a policy-local source asset.
- Policies are evaluated for applicability first. A policy that does not match
  its `when` conditions makes no change.
- Operations are deterministic and idempotent: a compliant repository can be
  evaluated repeatedly without producing further changes.
- A policy gathers its changes before applying them, so files created by one
  operation are not visible to later operations in that same evaluation.
- Invalid or ambiguous input is rejected during policy loading or evaluation;
  operations do not silently guess at an unsupported file format.
