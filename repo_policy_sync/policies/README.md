# Bundled policy overview

This directory contains the bundled repository policies. Each policy lives in
its own directory and is defined by a `policy.yml` file. The directory name is
the policy ID used by the CLI, policy-owned branches, and pull-request markers.

The policies are evaluated independently. A policy that does not match its
`when` conditions is not applicable and makes no change; a matching policy
reports or applies only the changes described by its own `ensure` operations.

For tutorials, how-to guides, interface reference, and design explanations,
use the [documentation index](../docs/README.md).

## Policies

| Policy | Responsibility | Typical lifecycle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs-as-code-gitignore` | Update `score_docs_as_code` Git ignore entries and remove legacy configuration files. | One-time cleanup |
| `minimal-bazel-module-declaration` | Keep `MODULE.bazel` limited to the repository-owned module name by removing version metadata. | One-time cleanup |
| `minimum-bazel-version` | Upgrade repositories to at least Bazel `8.6.0` and regenerate the lockfile when required. | Baseline maintenance |

The policy definitions and their executable before/after cases are the
authoritative detail. The [policy format reference](../docs/reference/policy-format.md)
covers the schema and operation semantics; the [run-a-policy how-to](../docs/how-to/run-a-policy.md)
covers execution.
