# Repository Cache

Maintain a local, disposable Git checkout of every repository in a GitHub
organization. Used by other SCORE tools that need to operate across an
entire organization's repositories without re-cloning them on every run.

Talks to GitHub exclusively through the `gh` CLI, and has zero non-stdlib
Python dependencies, so it can be installed standalone in another
Bazel-based or `uv`-based repository:

```bash
uv add repo-cache --git https://github.com/eclipse-score/score_tools --subdirectory repo_cache
```

Or run it directly with `uvx`, without adding it as a dependency anywhere:

```bash
uvx --from "git+https://github.com/eclipse-score/score_tools#subdirectory=repo_cache" score-repo-cache list --org eclipse-score
```

## CLI

```bash
score-repo-cache list --org eclipse-score
score-repo-cache sync --org eclipse-score --repo score --repo score_tools
```

`sync` clones each selected repository's default branch into
`~/.cache/repo-cache/<org>/<name>` (override with `--cache-dir`), or fetches
and resets an existing checkout back to a clean state if it was already
cloned there. Repositories with no Git references are reported as empty and
do not make the command fail; checkout, authentication, and other operational
errors remain failures.

## Library

```python
from repo_cache import default_cache_directory, sync_org

report = sync_org(org="eclipse-score", cache_dir=default_cache_directory())
for outcome in report.failures:
    print(outcome.repository.name, outcome.error)
for outcome in report.empty_repositories:
    print(outcome.repository.name, "is empty")
```

## Bazel

Add `@score_tools//repo_cache:repo_cache` to your `py_library`/`py_binary`
`deps` to use it from another Bazel workspace that depends on `score_tools`.

To run the CLI directly as a `py_binary`:

```bash
bazel run @score_tools//repo_cache:score-repo-cache -- list --org eclipse-score
```

(from within `score_tools` itself, drop the `@score_tools//` prefix:
`bazel run //repo_cache:score-repo-cache -- list --org eclipse-score`).
